"# C64WebMQTT"
This is a CONTIKI project for your C64.
It enables you to run an own webserver, read in a temperature via the user prot and
publish the data via MQTT V3.1 to an MQTT broker

This project based on Contiki OS Version 2.5 (https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/archive/refs/tags/2.5.zip)

The app is a combintaion of the work of Adam Dunkel (Contiki example for a webserver),
the work of Stephen Robinson for the MQTT Client implementaton 8https://github.com/esar/contiki-mqtt).

I combined all together to this fantastic app :-)
